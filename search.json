    "text": "Many adults in the United States consume Beer regularly. That being said, Businesses can make better economic decisions based on collected data about the beer markets and consumer demographics to improve upon their business, which will hopefully increase their profitability and decrease their costs. This analysis will provide the viewer with important information relating to how different demographics of individuals in different parts of the United States consume beer.\nOur project aims to point out consumer trends in the beer market based on real market data and visualizations. We will analyze how various demographic characteristics such as race, age, marital and perental status as well as geographic location affect one‚Äôs consumption of beer."

From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.\nNow, let‚Äôs calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we‚Äôll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase\naverage_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({\n    'quantity': 'mean', \n    'dollar_spent': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by average quantity and average spending\naverage_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\naverage_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting average quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting average spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.\nNext, we‚Äôll look at the total spending across different markets to see if there are any notable differences in spending habits geographically. To do this, we‚Äôll sum up the spending in each market and visualize it.\n\n# Calculate total spending in each market\nmarket_spending_summary = beer_data.groupby('market').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nmarket_spending_summary_sorted = market_spending_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending in each market\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='market', data=market_spending_summary_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Market')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Market')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the total spending on beer by market, showcasing the differences in spending habits across various regions.

This 10000 difference in fluid ounces consumed by these two slightly different demographic spheres of beer consumers suggests that people with younger children prefer to drink less beer than consumers with older children."

    "text": "10 Significance of The Project\nThe significance of this project lies in its potential implications for various real-world applications particularly within the realms of business strategies and Public Policy.\n\nBusiness Strategies: By understanding which types of beer are preferred in different states, companies can tailor their product offerings and marketing strategies to better meet consumer demand. For example, knowing that Bud Light is the most popular beer in certain states like Ohio and Missouri can inform breweries and distributors where to focus their promotional efforts and distribution channels. Additionally, insights into consumer demographics such as age, marital status, and parental status can help businesses refine their target segmentation and develop targeted advertising campaigns.\nPublic Policy: The findings of this project can also inform public policy decisions related to alcohol consumption and regulation. Understanding which states consume the most beer can guide policymakers in implementing effective strategies to address issues such as alcohol abuse and drunk driving. For instance, states with higher rates of beer consumption may need to allocate more resources towards enforcement of alcohol-related laws and prevention programs. Furthermore, insights into demographic variations in beer consumption, such as differences based on race and marital status, can inform public health initiatives aimed at reducing alcohol-related harm within specific population groups.\n\nOverall, this project serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders in both the private and public sectors to make informed decisions and develop strategies that promote responsible alcohol consumption and support the economic viability of businesses within the beer industry."
